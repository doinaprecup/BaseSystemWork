\section{Introduction}

Learning models of partially observable dynamical systems is very important in practice --- several alternatives...

General algorithms are not designed to exploit frequen patterns/structure in sequences of observations to speed-up learning --- but in practice with large observations and highly structured environments this might be necessary to achieve decent results

We propose a new model of predictive state representation for environments with discrete observations: the multi-step PSR (M-PSR)

We show how the standard spectral learning for PSR extends to M-PSR

Then we present a data-driven algorithm for selecting a particular M-PSR from data sampled from a structured partially observable environment

We evaluate the performance of our algorithms in an extensive collection of synthetic environments and conclude that...
