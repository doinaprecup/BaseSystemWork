\begin{quote}
A standard problem in machine learning is making accurate predictions in partially observable environments. Spectral algorithms which learn PSRs offer statistical consistency, but often have trouble with computational efficiency as the models they learn are too large. In practice, one solves this computational issue by truncating the original model, eliminating the weakest states. Despite this, performance with reduced models is often quite poor. With this issue in mind, we develop a novel extension to PSRs which we call Multi-PSRs. In addition, we provide two algorithms for M-PSRs, one for learning parameters and the other for making effective queries. The M-PSR leverages structure in observations sequences and expresses queries more compactly. This extended model shares all the benefits of the traditional PSR but performs far better for smaller models in experiments. We perform experiments of robot exploration in labyrinth environments and cover both the single observation case (timing) and the multiple observation case. We pick these environments as PSRs have been used for planning applications on these kinds of environments in the past (CITE). In our experiments, we show that the improvement of M-PSRs hold for varying amounts of data, environment sizes, and number of observations symbols.
