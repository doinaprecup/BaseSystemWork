\section{Fully Data-Driven Learning}

\subsection{Learning Transition Operators}

Here we present a greedy heuristic which learns our transition sequences $\sum'$ from observation data. We start with some notation. Let ...

\subsection{Learning the encoding function}

Here we provide a dynamic programming algorithm which can serve as $kappa$ for any M-PSR. Given a query string Q, and a set of transition sequences $\sum'$, the algorithm minimizes the number of sequences used in the partition. In other words, the algorithm minimizes $|k(Q)|$.
